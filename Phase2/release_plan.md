##Release Plan for Phase 2##

For phase 2, we decided to split up the team and work into two groups; front end (UI) and back end. Eric, Tyler, and Lana will be working on the front end, and Ben, Paul, and Thomas will be working on the back end. Vincent will be a "floater" between the two groups; he will ensure the work completed by each group coincides and he will work with whichever group has more work to be done or needs help. 

We will also have two sprints for phase 2; the first of which will end on October 29, and the second which will end on November 5. During these two sprints, we plan to implement and complete the following user stories:
