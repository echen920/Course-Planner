The project that our group has chosen to work on is a Web version of the Time Management Tool for Students. This product allows students(from U of T - Must have a @utoronto.ca or @mail.utoronto.ca email) to create an account and login to a web interface. Once the user is logged in they can add courses to their personal timetable and then view a list of thier courses. We have aldo added a visual calendar which you can display in either month or week format, currently not implemented. Once a user has added a course to thier personal timetable then can now add deadlines. Each dealine is associated with a specific class and contains a due date, a due time, a location, a specification (assignment, midterm, exam, etc.) and an optional notes section. Once these deadlines are set, the user can view a list of their deadlines. Finally, when A user is finished the can logout of the system.
