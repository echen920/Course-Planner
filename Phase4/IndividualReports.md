#Individual Reports

###Tyler Haugen-Stanley (g3haugen)
- What is your most significant individual contribution?
    - My most significant contribution to the project is getting the calendar to show up nicely and populating it with the information from the backend. This information included classes, tutorials, and deadlines. This involved writing queries to the database and also working with the JavaScript extension FullCalendar. Additionally I got events on the callendar to be colour coded on a per coruse basis, with deadlines taking on the same colour as their course.
- Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
    - Almost all of the architecture we used for our project I was unfamiliar with so I had to learn all of that information.  
- What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
    - My biggest strength as a team member is coordinating people, making sure work is assigned to everyone in a fair manner, and making sure everything is done for the due dates. 
- What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
    - My biggest weakness as a team member is my inexperience with the architecture used. I could have spent more time learning the various platforms so I could better manipulate the code base. 

###Svetlana Borodina (lanab13)
- What is your most significant individual contribution?
    - My most significant individual contribution was implementing the UI functionality of the 'Manage' and 'Course' pages. This includes retrieving input from the user for adding courses and deadlines to the account and calling the appropriate methods on the back end to process this information and populate the database. This also includes calling the appropriate methods on the back end to retrieve course information, deadlines, and students enrolled in each course, displaying this information to the user, and allowing the user to email individual or all students of a given course.  
- Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
    - I have never used a lot of the libraries and tools our group used for this project, including PostgreSQL, AngularJS, and web.py, so I learned how to use these libraries and tools. I also became better familiarized with and experienced in web development in terms of HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, and jQuery.  
- What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
    - My main strength as a team member is that I am a quick learner. If I do not know how to do something, I study the libraries, tools, and teach myself the knowledge and skills required to complete a task. I am also determined in completing a task I am assigned, even if I do not know how to do it at first. I ensure that I gain the required skills and knowledge, and my work is completed fully and without any errors. 
- What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
    - My main weakness as a team member is that I am a perfectionist and I can be a push-over at times. If a team member does not complete their part, and I cannot rely on them to complete their part for a given deadline, then I may do their work for them. I may also re-do other people's work if I feel it can be improved or it is not sufficient.  

###Eric Chuang-Yu (echen920)
- What is your most significant individual contribution?
    - My most significant contribution is most of the front end design, especially using HTML and CSS to make the layout more simplistic and intuitive.
- Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
    - I was unfamiliar with most of the back end architecture such as web.py and PostgreSQL and it took me some time to get the server set up and going.
- What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
    - I think my biggest strength is the design experience with the front end.
- What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
    - My main weakness is not being able to understand the entire back end architecture and I should spend more time learning how it works.

###Benjamin Feder (canadianbif)
- What is your most significant individual contribution?
    - My most significant contribution would have to be the entire password reset feature. This required implementing a security question and answer field when a user creates an account and then utilizing their personalized question and answer to allow them to create a new password if their old one was forgotten for whatever reason. It involved augmenting the database structure and populator, creating multiple new html pages, and implementing them into the backend which forced me to really wrap my head around exactly how everything works.
- Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
    - I learned all about web development and frameworks. I had minor experience with front end in the past, but seeing whats under the hood and how it all works together was really enlightening. I didn't previously know there were so many different pieces and languages coming together to display a functional webpage. I also have a greater understanding of why and how web development frameworks are used in real world applications.
- What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
    - I think my main strength was the ability to get down to work when the time called for it. When pressure is exerted onto me, I really feel like I excel and persevere. Also my creative input when looking at things from the user's perspective, I feel as though I am easily able to get into the mindset of the end-user, which aids in the development process greatly.
- What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
    - I think it would be a lack of communication. There were many facets of the code I was unfamiliar with and instead of asking how they functioned, I would more frequently opt to analyze and discover on my own how everything fit together. I think it gives me more satisfaction on a personal level but is not conducive to productive teamwork.

###Paul Floussov (Paul301)
- What is your most significant individual contribution?
    - My biggest contribution involved the back end work that I did for the assignment. I cleaned up and wrote a lot of the key CRUD methods as well as set the structure for naming of the URLs used.
- Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
    - I learned a lot of technical concepts while working on this project. The biggest was working with web.py as I had never before worked with it. I believe it was very beneficial for me both in terms of making future lightweight servers but also seeing how a RESTful API can be made in python.
- What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
    - I think my main strength was the backend experience that I had brought to the table. I had working on backend servers before, so I knew enough to be able to suggest what needs doing and how we should go about it.
- What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
    - I think my biggest weakness is being proactive about communicating, organizing and working as a team. 

###Vincent Le (VTL-Dev)
- What is your most significant individual contribution?
    - Setting up the backend, database and putting some of the ends together. As well as working on some of the API calls to the server, scrapping some course information and making a small script to populate the database.
- Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
    - One of the things I learned was working web.py, as I had never worked with it before. It was very light-weight and had nothing fancy compared to other frameworks. Another thing I learned was setting up the environment, and finding ways to make sure we had the same information on our database to minimize differences. All of these items involved research, and trying things out.
- What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
    - I think my main strength was my previous work experience in web development. This allowed me to work on the back end and quickly learn a new framework we had to use, web.py
- What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
    - I think I should improve on my teamwork skills when it comes to planning and organizing, and acting as a unit.

###Thomas Robinson (tomrdelhi)
- What is your most significant individual contribution?
    - My largest contributions were general backend fixes, methods and other small things, and documentation throughout the project.
- Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
    - I came into this project with little to no knowledge of web development (front end or back) so I ended up learning a lot about its basics, as well as some database management. 
- What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
    - A willingness to concede center stage and listen to those with more experience than me and an openness towards learning new frameworks and languages.
- What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
    - A lack of technical knowledge. Most of the members of our group were fourth years and many had experience in web development, whereas I had none. Also, towards the end of the project, I'll be the first to admit to a lack of communication on my part.
