**Benjamin Feder**

I am a third year student at the University of Toronto aiming to finish with a degree as a computer science specialist and a mathematics minor. I first learned how to program at U of T and quickly fell in love with the field. I have since learned many various languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, and Verilog, but the ones I am proficient at are Java and C. I most enjoy the theory behind computer science but find interest in all of its subsections. I previously worked for a start-up in New York named Totsy which used Magento, MySQL, and PHP for their backend along with Java to test their website. I am currently working on a web application with a couple friends which has been put on hold until schoolwork lightens up again.

**Thomas Robinson**

I am a third year U of T student specializing in computer science with a minor in mathematics. I'm fairly well versed in C, C++, java and python and have some limited experience in HTML and JavaScript. While I don't have any work experience relating to CS (beyond helping co-workers with whatever "damn thing" didn't happen to be working at a given time), I have completed a few personal projects, mostly in java, over the last couple of summers to try to ensure I didn't forget absolutely everything from year to year.


**Paul Floussov**

In my final year double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. Last year I did PEY at Loblaw’s for mobile and web development and then followed that up with an internship at Amazon. My interests are in web app development primarily in C# .Net and Java. Currently working on making a cross platform mobile web app which has been taking up all my available spare time. 

**Eric Chuang-Yu Chen**

I'm in my fourth year as a computer science specialist. I have years of experience with Java, C, objective-C, Python and most of the web development languages. I have interned for HTC as a user experience and front end developer. MY interests are mostly Android, iOS and web development. I'm currently working on a start-up idea with five other friends.

**Tyler Haugen-Stanley**

I began programming in High School in grade ten when I learned Turing and made my first video game by the end of the semester. After that I learned Java for two years in grade 11 and 12 and developed multiple different applications including a game of boggle, and a database for films. I am currently in my fourth year (of five) of my Computer Science Specialist with a focus in Game Design. Although I haven't interned at any company I am looking to work for Microsoft this summer and in the summer of 2013 I created a science education game for iOS under the supervision of Steve Engels which was demonstrated to 30 high school students at the end of the summer. I am interested in iOS and Android development and currently have a couple projects that I am working on which take up a lot of my free time.

**Vincent Le**

I am a fourth year student at the University of Toronto, doing a double major in "Computer Science" (CSC), and "Molecular Genetics and Microbiology" (MGY). I am proficient in Python and Java as well as having familiarity with C, C++, and Ruby. I have also done some web development working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Putting languages aside, I have also worked with various frameworks, such as Django, Ruby on Rails, LESS/Sass, Ionic, Cordova and AngularJS.

**Lana Borodina**

I began programming in grade nine where I learned Turing, followed by two years of Java. During high school, I also did work with web design for my family’s business. Currently, I am in my fourth and final year as a Computer Science Specialist. I have completed two summer internships with Microsoft, the first as an Explorer Intern and the second as a Software Development Engineer Intern. I also completed a Microsoft certificate in Windows Application Development with .NET Framework 4. For my Explorer internship, I did one month of each role of Program Manager, SDE, and SDET, writing mail applications for Outlook in JavaScript and XML. For my SDE internship, I returned to the same team and worked on a feature which I wrote in C++ and tested in C#. After I graduate, I will be returning to the same team at Microsoft for fulltime as an SDE.
