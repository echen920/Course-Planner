##Choosing the Project##

  The project that our group has chosen to work on is a Web version of the Time Management Tool for Students. The reason that we decided to work on this project as opposed to others was because we felt we could contribute more to this problem space than others. In our initial discussion we immediately began coming up with ideas of how we could create something useful to us. We unanimously agreed upon this choice.

  The Messaging Application for Universities we believed would challenge us with some interesting problems such as dealing with real time data. The biggest issue for us was that the problem space we would be working in has already many applications (Facebook, WhatsApp, Google Hangouts, ext...) and we didn't feel like we could create something original. The other option of a portal module we felt could be interesting but after discussion we couldn't agree on an idea that we all wanted to follow through on.

  The way we went about deciding on an idea was by meeting all together after tutorial and discussing the different options and different ideas that we had. It was effective to meet in person to discuss this topic as there was seven members and in person it was easy to address everyoneâ€™s concerns, ideas and thoughts immediately.
